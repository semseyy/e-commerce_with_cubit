# App Architecture

- &#9745; The *BloC (cubit)* structure was used to manage the state.
- &#9745; The *dio* package was used to pull the api.
- &#9745; I used the *shared_preferences* package to store the state of the favorite button in memory.
- &#9745; I utilized the *go_router* package to facilitate page navigation within the application.
- &#9745; I used the *carousel_slider* package to display products with sliding images on the homepage.
- &#9745; The *equatable* package was used to compare the objects.
